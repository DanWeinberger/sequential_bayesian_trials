# sequential_bayesian_trials

This Repository has the code required to replicate the analyses found in the manuscript "Incorporating efficacy data from initial trials into subsequent evaluations of 
vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus" by Joshua Warren, Maria Sundaram, Virginia Pitzer, Saad B. Omer, and Daniel Weinberger. The trials sequential_trials_novavax.Rmd
organizes the code and results. The R folder has functions called to simulate data, fit the model, and generate plots.
